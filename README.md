This is a project for Lukas Scarfe and Daniel Deiros to generate and investigate Eigenmodes of Turbulence for optical research.



# Things to do

1. Make a .py file for the functions so we can just import. DONE
2. Globally adjust output mode phase to be same (relatively) as input mode phase.
3. Make oversized (10x) fixed phase screens for different turbulence strengths and resolutions. Save in phase_screens folder or use fixed seed. Suggested Filenames resolutionsize_turbstrength_i.csv, up to you.
4. Make function to fetch an NxN section of the oversized phasescreens given an x,y coordinate.
5. Apply the subsection as the abberation.
